# ComfyUI-MultiGPU

## Device selection and model offloading tools for ComfyUI workloads that exceed single GPU capacity

This extension empowers users to spread model components across multiple GPUs or offload to CPU in a single ComfyUI workflow. Aimed at complex workloads that would normally require sequential model loading/unloading:

- Full control over model placement
- Support for all major model loader nodes
- NEW! GGUF UNet and CLIP model-splitting across cpu/gpus using new DisTorch nodes.

*EXPERIMENTAL: This extension modifies ComfyUI's memory management behavior. While functional for standard GPU and CPU configurations, edge cases may exist. Use at your own risk.*

**Note:** This enhances memory management, not parallelism. Workflow steps execute sequentially but with components, or in the case of GGUF files `GGML` layers, loaded across your specified devices. *Performance gains* come from avoiding repeated model loading/unloading when VRAM is constrained. *Capability gains* come from offloading as much of the model (VAE/CLIP/UNet) off of your main `compute` device, allowing you to maximize the amount of latent space available for `compute`

# NEW: DisTorch - Advanced GGUF-Quantized Model Layer Distribution

DisTorch nodes are now available, allowing fine-grained control over model layer distribution across multiple devices for GGUF quantized models. Using a simple allocation string (e.g., "cuda:0,0.025;cuda:1,0.05;cpu,0.10"), you can precisely specify how much memory each device should contribute to hosting model layers. This enables sophisticated memory management strategies like:

- Splitting large models across multiple GPUs with different VRAM capacities
- Utilizing CPU memory alongside GPU VRAM for handling memory-intensive models
- Optimizing layer placement based on your specific hardware configuration

Check out the updated examples `hunyuan_ip2v_distorch_gguf.json`, `hunyuan_gguf_distorch.json`, and `flux1dev_gguf_distorch.json` to see DisTorch in action, demonstrating advanced layer distribution across multiple devices including adapting kijai's `HunyuanVideo TextImageEncode (IP2V)` node for the native HunyuanVideo sampler in Comfy Core - meaning HunyuanVideo with IP2V has come to GGUFs!

### Split GGUF-quantized UNet and CLIP models across multiple devices using DisTorch

- [hunyuan_ip2v_distorch_gguf.json](https://github.com/pollockjj/ComfyUI-MultiGPU/blob/main/examples/hunyuan_ip2v_distorch_gguf.json)
This workflow attaches a HunyuanVideo GGUF-quantized model on `cuda:0` for compute and distrubutes its UNet across itself and the `cpu`. Kijai's IP2V clip loader is loaded on the `cpu`. While the VAE is loaded on GPU 1 directly and uses `cuda:1` for compute.

- [examples/hunyuan_gguf_distorch.json](https://github.com/pollockjj/ComfyUI-MultiGPU/blob/main/examples/hunyuan_gguf_distorch.json)
This workflow attaches a HunyuanVideo GGUF-quantized model on `cuda:0` for compute and distrubutes its UNet across itself, a secondary CUDA device, and the system's main memory (`cpu`) using a new DisTorch distributed-load methodology. The text encoder now attaches itself to `cuda:1` and splits iteself between `cuda:1` amd `cpu` layers. While the VAE is loaded on GPU 1 directly and uses `cuda:1` for compute.

- [examples/flux1dev_gguf_distorch.json](https://github.com/pollockjj/ComfyUI-MultiGPU/blob/main/examples/flux1dev_gguf_distorch.json)
This workflow loads a FLUX.1-dev model on `cuda:0` for compute and distrubutes its UNet across multiple CUDA devices using new DisTorch distributed-load methodology. While the text encoders and VAE are loaded on GPU 1 and use `cuda:1` for compute.

### Split Hunyuan Video UNet across two devices and use DiffSynth Just-in-Time loading

- [examples/hunyuanvideowrapper_diffsynth.json](https://github.com/pollockjj/ComfyUI-MultiGPU/blob/main/examples/hunyuanvideowrapper_diffsynth.json)
This workflow demonstrates DiffSynth's memory optimization strategy enabled in kijai's `ComfyUI-HunyuanVideoWrapper` UNet loader, splitting the UNet model across two CUDA devices using block-swapping. The main device handles active computations while blocks are swapped to and from the offload device as needed. As written, the CLIP loads on cuda:0 and then offloads, and the VAE is loaded after the UNet model has been cleared from memory after generation. This approach enables processing of higher resolution or longer duration videos that would exceed a single GPU's memory capacity, though at the cost of additional processing time. Note that an initial OOM error is expected as the workflow calibrates its memory management strategy - simply run the generation again with the same parameters.

### Split Hunyuan Video generation across multiple resources

- [examples/hunyuanvideowrapper_native_vae.json](https://github.com/pollockjj/ComfyUI-MultiGPU/blob/main/examples/hunyuanvideowrapper_native_vae.json)
This workflow uses two of the custom_node's loaders - putting the main video model on cuda0 and the CLIP onto the CPU. This workflow uses Comfy's native VAE loader to load the VAE onto a second cuda device, keeping model, VAE, and CLIP in their operating memory space at all times. This allows the benefit of kijai's proecessing node with the flexibility of a MultiGPU setup.

- [examples/hunyuanvideowrapper_select_device.json](https://github.com/pollockjj/ComfyUI-MultiGPU/blob/main/examples/hunyuanvideowrapper_select_device.json)
This workflow loads the main video model and VAE onto the cuda device and the CLIP onto the cpu. The model and VAE are linked in this example due to kijai's own extensive memory management assuming model and VAE are on the same device.

In this instance, a quantized video model's UNet and VAE are on GPU 0, whereas a split of one standard and one GGUF model text encoder are on the CPU. Requires [ComfyUI-GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF).
